# Contributing

Contributions are welcome and will be fully credited.

Please read and understand the contribution guide before creating an issue or pull request.

## Procedure

Before creating an issue:

- Attempt to replicate the problem to ensure that it wasn't something coincidental.
- Check to make sure your feature suggestion isn't already present within the project.
- Check the pull requests tab to ensure that the bug doesn't have a fix in progress.
- Check the pull requests tab to ensure that the feature isn't already in progress.

Before submitting a pull request:

- Check the codebase to ensure that your feature doesn't already exist.
- Check the pull requests to ensure that another person hasn't already submitted the feature or fix.

## Requirements

- **Tests, tests, tests!**: Your pull request won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Document behaviour changes**: Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **One pull request per feature**: If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Coherent history**: Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.
